## Overview
The puyrpose of the analysis was to determine whether or not an ice cream business would be profitable in Oahu, Hawaii given the weather in Summer and Winter. The data analyzed was for the months of June and December.

## Results
- The June temperatures ranged between 64 and 85 degrees with an average of 74.94 degrees. 
- The December temperatures ranged between 56 and 83 degrees with an average of 71.04.
- The standard deviation of both months was between 3 and 4 degrees. 

## Summary
The temperatures reveal that the business would do well due to the little variation in temperatures. The weather is mostly consistent and warm throughout the year. To get a better understanding of the overall weather, I would look at percipitation data for the two months of June and December to see if there are periods where inclimate weather would hinder the business from being successful.
